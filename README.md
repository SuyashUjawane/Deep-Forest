========
This is the official clone for the implementation of gcForest.

Package Official Website: http://lamda.nju.edu.cn/code_gcForest.ashx

Description: A python 2.7 implementation of gcForest proposed in [1].                                             
A demo implementation of gcForest library as well as some demo client scripts to demostrate how to use the code.  
The implementation is flexible enough for modifying the model or fit your own datasets.
