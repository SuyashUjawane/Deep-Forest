gcForest implementation v1.1.1 Is Here!
========
This is the official clone for the implementation of gcForest.                                    
A demo implementation of gcForest library as well as some demo client scripts to demostrate how to use the code.  
The implementation is flexible enough for modifying the model or fit your own datasets.                           

Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia is a neurodegenerative disease. This disease occurs when the neurons in the brain starts degenerating and it generally affects the elderly people. It has no cure if the patient is in the last stage, so the classification of the disease at an early stage is very important for the treatment. Nowadays doctors widely use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose various neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, but this method is prone to
human error.Nowdays,Deep learning plays a vital role in the classification,detection and segmentation of data. But the disadvantage behind that is it requires a large amount of data in the training and testing of the model. so, In this project we have classified the Alzheimer’s disease with the help of deep forest.Which combines the technique of RandomForest and Deep
Learning.In this case, the model also learns the intermediate features,which are generated during classification and combines it with original characteristics for further classification.Experimentation is performed on data collected from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database and pre-processed using FreeSurfer. The accuracy of the 2-way
classification using the described method between initial and final stage is 85.62 ± 5.22 % for the test set.
